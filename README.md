## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - React form with easy-to-use validation

### What I learned

In this project, I used Next.js, a popular framework for building server-side rendered React applications. While working on this project, I gained a solid understanding of the basics of Next.js, including its folder structure, server-side rendering capabilities, and built-in routing system.

In addition, I used the React Hook Form library for custom form validation. This was my first time working with this library, and I found it to be a very helpful tool for simplifying form management in React. With React Hook Form, I was able to easily handle form inputs, validate user input, and manage form submission state.
